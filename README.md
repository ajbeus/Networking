# Phone remote control

This project is a basic web-based remote control for my laptop. As long as my laptop and phone are connected to the same Wi-Fi, I can press buttons to move the mouse, right and left click, and even enter text. 


## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Download python and VS code, and ensure that the most recent version of Flask is imported
2. Choose a port number to host the server (usually 5000)
3. Find out you PC's IP address by entering "ipconfig" in command prompt, and noting what it says under "ipv4 Address"

Instructions for using the software:

1. Run the python server file
2. Go onto your phone's browser and type "http://[your IP address]:5000"
3. Use the remote control buttons as instructed

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] I would like to add a mouse trackpad at the bottom of the screen; I created a prototype but it was too laggy. If this doesn't work, I will allow the user to press and hold the mouse buttons so it will move faster
* [ ] I would like to change up the CSS to make it more mobile friendly
